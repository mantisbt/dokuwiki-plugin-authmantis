## Compatibility

This plugin has been tested with the following DokuWiki releases:

- 2013-05-10 “Weatherwax”


## Installation and Configuration

Install the plugin following standard
[instructions](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin_installation_instructions)
from the DokuWiki website.

Make sure it is installed in `lib/plugins/authmantis/` - if the folder is
called differently, it will not work!

### ACL setup

Setup the Access Control List groups as appropriate for your environment by 
defining entries in `acl.auth.php` for each access level defined in your 
MantisBT instance. 

For example, with default MantisBT access levels your setup could be:
```
# MantisBT access levels
*  @VIEWER         1
*  @REPORTER       2
*  @UPDATER        4
*  @DEVELOPER      8
*  @MANAGER        16
*  @ADMINISTRATOR  16
```

### Set the Authentication Backend

1. Open the DokuWiki _Configuration Manager_
2. In the _Authentication_ section:
   - **Check** _Use access control lists_
   - Select **authmantis** as _Authentication Backend_
   - Enter **@ADMINISTRATOR** as _Superuser_
3. In the _Authmantis_ section:
   - Set the path to your MantisBT installation (i.e. the location of the 
     `core.php` file).  
4. **Save** the changes.

Alternatively, you can manually edit `local.php` or `local.protected.php`:
```
$conf['useacl']      = 1;
$conf['authtype']    = 'authmantis';
$conf['superuser']   = '@ADMINISTRATOR';
$conf['plugin']['authmantis']['mantis_root'] = '/path/to/mantisbt/';
```

This plugin is based on the Authentication back-end written by Victor Boctor,

wiki ([2012-12-01 13:26]) was used to develop it. Please refer to the page's
